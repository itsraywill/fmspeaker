<h2><strong>Why you should clean your headphones</strong></h2>
<p>If you use headphones for exercise, cleaning the ear cushions regularly is crucial. Sweat can potentially seep into the cushions' inner foam, causing discoloration and an unpleasant smell. Wipe down your headphones at least once a week, especially after working out, to avoid replacing them as often. </p>
<p>Sometimes, you share your headphones with your friends to listen to music; if your friend has an ear infection, you increase your risk of getting it. So, make sure to clean your headphones at home regularly. Now, after this in-depth guide, it will be easier for you to do it.</p>
<h2><strong>Basic Tools to Clean Headphones</strong></h2>
<p>To clean your headphones at home, you must have some tools to clean your headphones and headset cushions to get rid of dirt, muffled sound, and low-quality sound. I have listed all the tools below so you can check them.</p>
<ul>

<h2><strong>How To Clean Headphones</strong></h2>
<p>Start cleaning the headphones once you have all the tools on your table. Now, it's time to learn how to Clean Headphones. Cleaning headphone cushions are also part of this guide. Check out this detailed tutorial below. Follow these simple steps:</p>
<ul>
  <li>In the first step, remove the earpads of your headphones by pulling the top away from the earcup. Ten tabs hold the tabs around the headphones' inner rim. After pulling them, you can easily remove them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>After removing the earpads of your headphones, take a soft, clean cloth and lightly dampen it with soapy water, wringing out any excess liquid. The cloth should be damp, not wet.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Use the dampened cloth to scrub dirt, ear wax, and other dust particles from the front and back of the headphones' cushions. Later, you can dry the cushions using any air dryer. You can also repeat the same process to clean the other parts of the headphones.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The electronics below could be harmed if the screen covering the inner headphones gets wet. A dry cloth can remove dust from the screen.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Get a paper towel and put a small amount of rubbing alcohol on the paper to start removing any dirt and germs from the exterior part of the headphones. Make sure you clean it regularly because you are using this daily.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>You need to use a soft-bristled brush to remove dust particles. If dust or particles are inside the charging port of your headphones, Tweezers can also be used to remove any small particles or hair inside the port, but be careful when cleaning the headphones.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Before resembling your headphones, you must wait to dry the earpads completely.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Important Tip:</strong> Connect your headphones to your Phone or iPhone and open any <strong>" Fix my speaker "</strong> sound online to remove dust or eject water.</li>
</ul>
